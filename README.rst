* TODO (for now)

  - make it work with the latest version of `pdfminer` (20140328)
  - tidy up code base including PEP 8 compliance
  - review test cases and identify a set of pdf files to use for testing
  - Add some documentation
  - Confirm that Scraper Wiki is no longer interested in this and if this is
    the case change name of the package for release on PyPI
